# Roadmap for Completing AI MUD

This roadmap outlines the major features and tasks remaining to complete your AI MUD project. It is divided into core game mechanics, backend/infrastructure, user interface, testing & debugging, and documentation/deployment.

---

## 1. Core Game Mechanics

### 1.1 Doors of Gold / AI-Generated Zones
- **AI Generation Module**
  - Develop a dedicated module (e.g., `ai_generator.py`) that creates dungeon layouts using a given theme.
  - Generate rooms, NPCs, items, and puzzles that align with the established lore.
- **Zone Integration**
  - Integrate “Doors of Gold” within specific rooms to trigger AI-generated content.
  - Manage the lifecycle of these generated zones so that they persist until the weekly reset.

### 1.2 Time Loop Narrative & Reset Logic
- **Weekly Reset**
  - Implement a reset routine that wipes all AI-generated zones and puzzle states.
  - Ensure the default village layout and base puzzles are restored.
  - Retain persistent player progress (levels/points) across resets.
- **Mid-Week Reset**
  - Create logic for archmage-initiated resets and inactivity-based resets.
  - Define which game states (player positions, puzzle progress) revert versus those that persist (e.g., AI zones).
- **Archmage Commands**
  - Implement special commands (e.g., `reset`, `teleport to underswamp`) unlocked at higher levels.

### 1.3 Puzzles & Interactivity
- **Puzzle System Design**
  - Define puzzle templates with triggers, required items, and outcomes.
  - Establish a state management system for tracking solved/unsolved puzzles and item placements.
- **Interactive Commands**
  - Expand the command parser to support new actions such as `knock on door`, `chop yew tree with axe`, or `push statue`.
  - Link puzzle interactions to rewards such as points or treasure.

### 1.4 Combat System
- **Combat Flow & Mechanics**
  - Design a continuous, turn-based combat system that factors in player stats, weapon bonuses, and random damage.
  - Implement commands like `attack <target>`, `kill <target> with <weapon>`, and a robust `flee` command (with associated penalties like item drops or point loss).
- **NPC & Mob Interactions**
  - Create AI behaviors for mobs, with scalable stats based on the zone theme.
  - Integrate combat outcomes with inventory and player stat modifications.

### 1.5 Player Progression & Inventory
- **Leveling System**
  - Tie point thresholds to level-ups and stat improvements.
  - Ensure levels and points are persisted across both mid-week and weekly resets.
- **Inventory Management**
  - Refine inventory limits (number and weight) and implement checks.
  - Support new item types (e.g., puzzle tools, treasure, weapons) and interactions like swamping treasure for points.

## 2. Backend & Infrastructure

### 2.1 Data Persistence & State Management
- Enhance current JSON-based storage or consider migrating to a database.
- Separate baseline snapshots (for weekly resets) from dynamic states used in mid-week resets.

### 2.2 Networking and Session Handling
- Optimize the Socket.IO command queue and background tick processing.
- Improve session management, including error handling and disconnection routines.

### 2.3 Integration with AI Services
- Set up communication channels with AI services or internal modules for generating themed content.
- Design prompt structures to ensure the generated content remains coherent with the game’s lore.

---

## 3. User Interface & Experience

### 3.1 Client Enhancements
- Enhance the React client to display rich room descriptions, notifications, and interactive elements.
- Add UI components for inventory management, player stats, and real-time game updates.

### 3.2 In-Game Notifications & Social Features
- Implement notifications for player arrivals, resets, and important game events.
- Consider features for displaying online players, chat functions, and other social interactions.

---

## 4. Testing, Debugging, and Polishing

### 4.1 Unit & Integration Testing
- Develop tests for individual modules (authentication, command processing, AI generation, puzzles, combat).
- Conduct integration testing to validate complete game flows (login, gameplay, resets).

### 4.2 User Feedback & Balancing
- Run playtests to gather feedback on gameplay, AI content generation, and puzzle difficulty.
- Iterate on balancing combat mechanics, puzzles, and overall progression.

### 4.3 Performance Optimization
- Profile and optimize the background tick service and Socket.IO performance.
- Ensure smooth operation under varying player loads.

---

## 5. Documentation & Deployment

### 5.1 Developer Documentation
- Expand the design document as features are implemented.
- Maintain clear API and module documentation for future collaborators.

### 5.2 Deployment & Monitoring
- Prepare the production server environment and set up robust monitoring/logging.
- Plan for scalability and potential migration to a more robust data storage system if needed.
