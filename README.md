# AI MUD

AI MUD is a text-based multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that uses AI to generate content.

## Features

- Character creation, strict-levelling progression
- Exploration
- Combat with other players
- Inventory system
- NPCs that move around -- no need for interaction
- Game is mostly based on puzzles that when solved, will give you treasure and maybe points. The treasure can be "swamped" for points.
- As AI generates the world, that world becomes **permanent** and interactable by other players. Rooms don't tend to mutate much by AI - the AI creates the rooms, generates the rules and NPCs associated, and items, and then the room is there for other players to interact with as well
- The world will fully reset every week, starting back to an original "village" state - this village state will be defined by me
- The world that the AI generates must be internally consistent, and the AI must be able to generate believable content, and try and keep a consistent tone and storyline.
